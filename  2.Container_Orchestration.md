#### Introduction

With container images, we confine the application code, its runtime, and all of its dependencies in a pre-defined format. And, with container runtimes like **runC**, **containerd**, or **cri-o** we can use those pre-packaged images, to create one or more containers. All of these runtimes are good at running containers on a single host. But, in practice, we would like to have a fault-tolerant and scalable solution, which can be achieved by creating a single **controller/management unit**, after connecting multiple nodes together. This controller/management unit is generally referred to as a **container orchestrator**. 

In this chapter, we will explore why we should use container orchestrators, different implementations of container orchestrators, and where to deploy them.

#### Learning Objectives

Define the concept of container orchestration.
